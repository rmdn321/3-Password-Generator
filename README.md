## Overview

### The challenge

This week's Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. This week's coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.
The password can include special characters.

### User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
